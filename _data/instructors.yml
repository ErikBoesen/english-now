She’s taught ESL at the Washington English Center since 2017 and expects to receive her TEFL Certificate from Georgetown University in May, 2019. When not preparing lesson plans, Nancy reads and writes, loyally attends meetings of her book club and writers group and watches British crime series on Netflix.
