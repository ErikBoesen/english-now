    <h2 class="heading">YOUTH FACING THE GLOBAL MIGRATION AND REFUGEE CRISIS: A DIPLOMATIC SIMULATION &amp; ADVOCACY PROGRAM</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Do you want to learn to negotiate international crises like a diplomat? Do you want to experience advocacy regarding migration and refugee issues in the U.S. and around the world?</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>This is an online program for high school students who are interested in experiencing global citizenship, learning about diplomacy, and engaging in advocacy related to global migration.</strong></p>
    <p>This program has been designed especially for high school students with an international background (ESOL or otherwise), but students without an international background are <u>very</u> welcome to join as well.</p>
    <p>This program has two components: 1) a Diplomatic Simulation designed by the U.S. Department of State and 2) an Advocacy Service Project that invites students to engage domestic and global stakeholders with an interest in migration and the care of refugees.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>DIPLOMACY. In two online sessions, STUDENTS WILL LEARN HOW TO NEGOTIATE AN INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION CRISIS INVOLVING REFUGEE RIGHTS AND BORDER SECURITY. </strong>Student will participate in a Diplomatic Simulation designed by the U.S. Department of State. Students will work in small groups to represent &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; (e.g. countries, multilateral organizations, NGOs) in a negotiation process. See <a href="https://diplomacy.state.gov/">here</a> for information about the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s National Museum of American Diplomacy, which has designed and which offers these simulations, and <a href="https://diplomacy.state.gov/discover-diplomacy/about/class-materials/migration/">here</a> for the simulation that students will complete in this program.</p>
    <img src="/images/community-service/diplomacy-1.jpg">
    <p>This Diplomatic Simulation program will include <strong>two (2) online preparation and negotiation Sessions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <u>First Online Session </u>on Monday, December 7, students will receive their scenario materials and will be divided into stakeholder teams representing the affected countries, the United Nations and a non-governmental refugee rights organization. Teams will meet to prepare their negotiating strategies.</li>
        <li>In the <u>Second Online Session</u> on Wednesday, December 9, students representing their stakeholder teams will learn how to prepare, strategize, and negotiate with each other in informal and formal negotiation sessions, with the goal of achieving a diplomatic solution to the immigration and refugee crisis scenario.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ADVOCACY. In addition, STUDENTS WILL COMPLETE AN ADVOCACY SERVICE PROJECT,</strong> at home under the guidance of program facilitators, following the conclusion of the Diplomacy Simulation.</p>
    <p>Students will write letters and/or emails advocating action on issues of their choice related to the topics addressed in the Diplomatic Simulation. Issues addressed include (but are not limited to) asylum, border security, human rights, immigration, migration, and/or refugees.</p>
    <p>Under the guidance of the facilitators of the Diplomatic Simulation, students will study how advocacy and letter-writing campaigns work, engage in research regarding an issue of concern to them, review templates of effective advocacy communications created by non-profit organizations, and finally, draft, undergo an editing process and send their letters to elected representatives and/or to the governmental or non-governmental organizations of their choice.</p>
    <img src="/images/community-service/diplomacy-2.jpg">
    <p><strong>Taken together, this program consists of:</strong> four (4) hours of preparation for and the conduct of the Diplomatic Simulation, plus four (4) hours of engagement in the Advocacy Service Project.

    <h2 class="heading">Youth Facing Racism</h2>
    <h3>A Four-week Program for High School Students Engaging American Experiences of Race, Ethnicity, and Identity</h3>
    <p>This dynamic SSL program for high school students - offered by English Now!’s community service partner Washington Center for International Education - includes eight online small group discussions as well as a service project completed at Corhaven Graveyard, a historical burial ground for African-Americans who were enslaved in Shenandoah County, Virginia.</p>
    <p>This course has been designed especially for high school students with an international background (ESOL or otherwise), but students without an international background are very welcome to join as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Online small group discussions.</strong> Small group discussions - maximum six students - focus on "names" and include three units: Say Your Name, Say My Name, and Say Their Names. In the first unit, Say Your Name, we discuss the importance of identity through the framework of our names. In the second unit, Say My Name, students hear high school students' stories and explore ways to promote awareness and change around racism, stereotypes, and bias. In the third unit, Say Their Names, students will meet online with "poet ambassadors" from the <a href="https://freemindsbookclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freemindsbookclub.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601404905558000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRJFctWctjydjFoQvjmTABJM3FpA">Freeminds Book Club</a>. These young adults, who had been incarcerated in their youth, will share their stories and explain how reading and writing poetry has changed their lives.</p>
    <img src="/images/community-service/CorhavenGraveyard-1.jpg">     
    <p><strong>Service learning field trip.</strong> In addition to the three units described above, the program includes a service learning field trip to <a href="http://www.corhavengraveyard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.corhavengraveyard.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601404905558000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZvg0brS30SKComieMusbRDSY3GQ">Corhaven Graveyard</a>. Corhaven Graveyard is a historical burial ground for enslaved people. It has been developed as a site of remembrance and reconciliation. Participants in the field trip will complete a volunteer service project to improve the grounds of the graveyard. Enslaved people did not control their own names nor the names of their children. Participants in the field trip will engage in guided reflection regarding the lives of the enslaved people buried there, as well as their names - some known, many not, along with completing a service project.</p>
    <p>Taken together, this program consists of four weeks of online discussion sessions meeting twice a week, plus a 2/3-day field trip on Saturday, October 17. **Students (or their families) will need to provide their own transportation for the field trip program, which takes place in Quicksburg, Virginia.**</p>
