    <h2 style="clear: both;" class="heading">Year-Round Community Service Programs</h2>
    <p><strong>Community Service for Adults.</strong> English Now! and WCIE encourage international residents of the Washington, D.C. area to consider volunteering. Volunteering offers an opportunity to speak English outside the classroom, meet people, and engage across cultures.</p>
    <p><strong>Student Service Learning (SSL) for International Teens.</strong> WCIE also organizes programs that enable international teens to earn SSL service hours. SSL service hours are required for high school graduation in State of Maryland public schools and are encouraged in many private schools. For information about WCIE's SSL programs, see <a target="_blank" href="files/WCIE - Student Service Learning Programs for International Teens.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Community Service Weeks.</strong> For the last five years, we have offered two Community Service Weeks a year, in the spring and fall. Community Service Weeks offer many options to participate in small group community service activities. We are excited to announce that our Spring 2021 Community Service Week will take place from April 9th-17th, 2021, with a bonus event on the 22nd; our Fall 2021 Community Service Week will occur September 10th-19th.
