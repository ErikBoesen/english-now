    <p><strong>English Now! Conversation Courses</strong> offer two to six hours of instruction per week and are available during the daytime or on Saturdays. These courses are designed for English learners from high beginner to advanced levels. Classes focus on improving conversation ability with an emphasis on proper use of English grammar, vocabulary development, pronunciation improvement and accent reduction.</p>
    <p>The maximum number of students per class is six for in-person classes, ensuring that each student receives significant attention. Small class sizes are even more important online, so the maximum class size is even smaller for our online Global Conversation Courses&mdash;four students maximum.</p>
    <p><strong>Students:</strong> Students may enroll in in-person or online classes. Students are joining our classes from all over the world&mdash;ask us about options that would be convenient for your time zone and appropriate to your level of English&mdash;and join our Global Conversation Courses, to connect with international classmates, advance your English, and engage with a special school community.</p>
    <p><strong>Dates and schedules:</strong> Conversation Courses meet one, two, or three days per week, for 1.5 to 2.5 hours each session. In order to determine placement in one of our Conversation Courses, we ask that you take a placement test (there is no cost and no commitment for the test). We can email you a link to a written test. Common schedules include Wednesday morning classes, meeting 9:30am until 12:15pm; or afternoon classes that meet Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday afternoons, 12:45 until 2:15pm.</p>
    <p><strong>Schedules:</strong> English Now! has as many as seven Conversation Courses offered at any given time. Call us for enrollment options, which will be based on your level of English proficiency, your interests, and class availability.</p>
