    <p><strong>English Now! Online Conversation Courses</strong> offer two to six hours of instruction per week. These courses are designed for English learners from high beginner to advanced levels. Classes focus on improving conversation ability with an emphasis on proper use of English grammar, vocabulary development, pronunciation improvement and accent reduction.</p>
    <p><strong>The maximum number of students per online class is six.</strong> Small class sizes are even more important online than in-person.</p>
    <p><strong>Students:</strong> Students are joining our classes from all over the world—ask us about options that would be convenient for your time zone and appropriate to your level of English—and join our classes to connect with international classmates, advance your English, and engage with a special school community.</p>
    <p><strong>Dates and schedules:</strong> Conversation Courses meet one, two, or three days per week, for 1.5 to 2.5 hours each session. In order to determine placement in one of our Conversation Courses, we ask that you take a placement test (there is no cost and no commitment for the test). We can email you a link to a written test.</p>
    <p><strong>Schedules:</strong> Contact us for enrollment options, which will be based on your level of English proficiency, your interests, and class availability.</p>

Tuition for Wednesday morning classes that meet 9:30am until 12:15pm is $330 for six weeks. Information about tuition for other class schedules is available – contact us.</p>
