    <h4>Dates</h4>

Depending on the time of year, students join a newly-formed group or an existing group, at their level. Students stay in the program for an average of four to six months, in successive four-week terms, or based on holidays or student travel may enroll in a partial term of less than four weeks, if they wish. Continuing students progress to a higher level in the curriculum and do not repeat course materials.</p>
