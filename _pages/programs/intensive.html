        <li>Gain confidence speaking and develop the skills to reach personal and professional goals.</li>
        <li>Learn and review essential grammatical constructions.</li>
        <li>Expand vocabulary by using new words in context of engaging materials and conversations.</li>
        <li>Develop listening, reading, and writing skills for a variety of situations.</li>
    </ul>
