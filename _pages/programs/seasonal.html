    <h1>Seasonal Programs for High School/University Students Study with English Now! During Your School Vacation</h1>
    <p>Improve your language skills when you have time to focus on your English. English Now!'s classes are probably very different than the ones in your home country. Our classes enroll a maximum of six students, so you should expect an engaging, dynamic, and personalized class experience. You will actually speak English - and you will know your teacher, your teacher will know you, and you will meet classmates from around the world in a very different classroom environment than in your home country.</p>
    <p><strong>Calendar.</strong> We are glad to welcome you to classes during your time off, especially in January-February (for students in South America), or in June-August. Many students choose to study with us when they are on vacation from high school or university studies, before starting a new phase of their education or a new semester of school.</p>
    <p><strong>Online and in-person.</strong> Our students have studied in private lessons online since 2015 and have been enjoying small group classes online since March 2020. We look forward to coming back to the classroom when it is safe to do so--in Summer 2021--but we will continue to offer fully online programs to reach students around the world, even when we are back in the classroom.</p>
    <p><strong>The academic program.</strong> Our small group Semi-Intensive/Intensive English Program classes &ndash; six students maximum &ndash; engage students in a dynamic online classroom environment, developing language and critical thinking skills that prepare students for a rapidly-changing world.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>The school community.</strong> When you enroll, and even after you finish your studies with us, you can join dynamic community learning activities with our students and alumni from around the world. Check out our most recent Student and Alumni Activity Calendar.

        We host discussions and learning events, both online and in-person when possible, because we believe that the purpose of language is to build understanding among people.
