    <h1>Express Yourself with Confidence in English</h1>
    <img src="/images/workplace-english/1.jpg">
    <p>The goal of English Now!'s online English for Workplace Communication courses is to help professionals from a variety of fields feel more confident using English in their professional lives. Adjusting to a new workplace in the United States can be challenging, even for native speakers of English. For non-native speakers, even after years of studying English, it can be very difficult to communicate effectively in a professional environment. We provide students with the coaching and practice they need to speak and understand English in typical workplace situations, from the conference room to the break room. Special attention is given to participating in meetings, including asking and answering questions, agreeing and disagreeing, and delivering presentations. Students will learn useful expressions and gain the skills they need to have more fulfilling interactions with their colleagues. Our maximum class size for these online classes is six students, a small class size that ensures personal attention from your instructor. </p>
