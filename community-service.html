    <p>English Now! and our community service partner, the Washington Center for International Education (WCIE), organize volunteer activities year-round.</p>
    <p>Our goals are to connect the Washington, D.C. international community to the local community, and to help others. We hope you can join us!</p>
    <p><strong>Community Service for Adults.</strong> English Now! and WCIE encourage international residents of the Washington, D.C. area to consider volunteering. Volunteering offers an opportunity to speak English outside the classroom, meet people, and engage across cultures.</p>
    <p><strong>Student Service Learning (SSL) for International Teens.</strong> WCIE also organizes programs that enable international teens to earn SSL service hours. SSL service hours are required for high school graduation in State of Maryland public schools and are encouraged in many private schools. For information about WCIE's SSL programs, see <a target="_blank" href="files/WCIE - Student Service Learning Programs for International Teens.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Community Service Weeks.</strong> For the last five years, we have offered two Community Service Weeks a year, in the spring and fall. Community Service Weeks offer many options to participate in small group community service activities. For a typical schedule of activities&mdash;for our Fall 2019 Community Service Week&mdash;see <a target="_blank" href="files/English Now!-WCIE - Community Service Week - Fall 2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">NOW &mdash; FOR SPRING 2020 &mdash; COMMUNITY SERVICE MONTH</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In Spring 2020, the world is confronting a global pandemic. Many people are suffering, and English Now! and WCIE are responding with more than just a Community Service Week&mdash;we are organizing a Community Service <u>Month</u>.</p>
    <p>Community Service Month focuses immediately on basic needs&mdash;food security. Many in our community may not have enough food, as the economic impact of the public health crisis hits.</p>
    <p>Please consider participating in our <strong><q>Online Food Drive</q></strong>. Help by ordering online grocery deliveries to one of two great organizations. This food will go directly to people in need, in the community, through these organizations.</p>
    <img src="images/bethesdacares.png">
    <p><a href="http://bethesdacares.org/">Bethesda Cares</a> is a great, local organization that serves the homeless in Bethesda and Montgomery County.
