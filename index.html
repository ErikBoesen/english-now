    <p>We take a distinctive approach to English language study. Our students benefit from personalized instruction in unusually small classes.

    <p>Serving the Washington, D.C. area international community since 1991, English Now! offers English language courses for students of all levels. Our school is conveniently located close to the Bethesda Metro, and we also offer classes offsite at embassies as well as at students’ homes or offices. In addition to classes at our school and offsite, we also offer <a href="online-programs">online small group classes and private lessons</a>, taking our personalized approach to language education to the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Engage.</strong> Our classes are engaging. Small class sizes encourage students to participate actively in class discussions. Research shows that small classes are one of the most important factors in excellence in language education. Participate in <a href="activities">student activities</a>, experience an active program of <a href="community-service">volunteering and community service</a>, and <a href="en-outdoors">get outside</a>, to better experience life in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy.</strong> We offer a warm, welcoming atmosphere to a wonderfully diverse group of students. Our classes are small, so our instructors know our students, and our students know each other. Our center is also small enough so the school community is <a href="student-services">caring and supportive</a>. Studying a language is challenging, and our joyful atmosphere helps many students persevere to achieve their goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Thrive.</strong> "Thrive" means to develop well, to prosper, and to flourish. We hope that our students thrive in their communication skills, their relationships, and their lives, through their studies with us.</p>
    <p>Our classes are probably very different than language classes in your country or elsewhere in the U.S. We look forward to welcoming you to our school or meeting you online.
