    <h1>Engage. Enjoy. Thrive.</h1>
    <p>We take a distinctive approach to English language study. Our students benefit from personalized instruction in unusually small classes. Online group classes enroll a maximum of six students. Contact us and tell us more about your language education needs and interests. We look forward to meeting you!</p>
    <p>English Now! has served the Washington, D.C. area international community since 1991, offering English language courses for students of all levels. We no longer teach in-person in Bethesda, but we continue to offer small group classes and private lessons online, taking our personalized approach to language education to the world. We miss our in-person classes in what was a very special school environment (see the photo!) – but many of the same instructors who taught with us in-person in Bethesda are continuing online, continuing with a uniquely personalized approach to language education.</p>

    <p><strong>Engage.</strong> Our classes are engaging. Small class sizes encourage students to participate actively in class discussions. Research shows that small classes are one of the most important factors in excellence in language education.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy.</strong> Our instructors are warm and welcoming, and we teach a wonderfully diverse group of students. Because our classes are small, our instructors know our students, and our students know each other. Studying a language is challenging, and our joyful atmosphere helps many students persevere to achieve their goals.
</p>
    <p><strong>Thrive.</strong> "Thrive" means to develop well, to prosper, and to flourish. We help our students thrive in their communication skills, their relationships, and their lives, through their studies with us.
</p>
    <p>Our classes are probably very different than language classes in your country or elsewhere in the U.S. We look forward to meeting you online. Call us or schedule a video call to experience just how different English Now!’s approach to language education can be.</p>
